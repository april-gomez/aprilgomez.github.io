			There was a boy
			Very strange, enchanted boy
			They say he wandered very far
			Very far over land and sea
			A little shy and sad of eye
			But very wise was he
			And then one day
			A magic day he passed my way
			Though we talked of many thing, fools and kings
			This he said to me
			"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
			Is just to love and be loved in return"
			Starry, starry night
			Paint your palette blue and gray
			Look out on a summer's day
			With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
			Shadows on the hills
			Sketch the trees and the daffodils
			Catch the breeze and the winter chills
			In colors on the snowy linen land
			Now I understand
			What you tried to say to me
			How you suffered for your sanity
			How you tried to set them free
			They would not listen, they did not know how
			Perhaps they'll listen now
			Starry, starry night
			Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
			Swirling clouds in violet haze
			Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china-blue
			Colors changing hue
			Morning fields of amber grain
			Weathered faces lined in pain
			Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
			Now I understand
			What you tried to say to me
			How you suffered for your sanity
			And how you tried to set them free
			They would not listen, they did not know how
			Perhaps they'll listen now
			For they could not love you
			But still your love was true
			And when no hope was left in sight
			On that starry, starry night
			You took your life, as lovers often do
			But I could've told you, Vincent
			This world was never meant for
			One as beautiful as you
			Starry, starry night
			Portraits hung in empty halls
			Frameless heads on nameless walls
			With eyes that watch this world and can't forget
			Like the strangers that you've met
			The ragged men in ragged clothes
			A silver thorn of bloody rose
			Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
			Now I think I know
			What you tried to say to me
			How you suffered for your sanity
			And how you tried to set them free
			They would not listen, they're not listening still
			Perhaps they never will
			You're gonna do that for me?
			I'm gonna do this for you

			What you tried to say to me
			How you suffered for your sanity
			How you tried to set them free
			They would not listen, they did not know how
			Perhaps they'll listen now
			Starry, starry night
			Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
			Swirling clouds in violet haze
			Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china-blue
			Colors changing hue
			Morning fields of amber grain
			Weathered faces lined in pain
			Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
			Now I understand
			What you tried to say to me
			How you suffered for your sanity
			And how you tried to set them free
			They would not listen, they did not know how
			Perhaps they'll listen now
			For they could not love you
			But still your love was true
			And when no hope was left in sight
			On that starry, starry night
			You took your life, as lovers often do
			But I could've told you, Vincent
			This world was never meant for
			One as beautiful as you
			Starry, starry night
			Portraits hung in empty halls
			Frameless heads on nameless walls
			With eyes that watch this world and can't forget
			Like the strangers that you've met
			The ragged men in ragged clothes
			A silver thorn of bloody rose
			Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

			There was a boy
			Very strange, enchanted boy
			They say he wandered very far
			Very far over land and sea
			A little shy and sad of eye
			But very wise was he
			And then one day
			A magic day he passed my way
			Though we talked of many thing, fools and kings
			This he said to me
			"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
			Is just to love and be loved in return"
			Starry, starry night
			Paint your palette blue and gray
			Look out on a summer's day
			With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
			Shadows on the hills
			Sketch the trees and the daffodils
			Catch the breeze and the winter chills
			In colors on the snowy linen land

			What you tried to say to me
			How you suffered for your sanity
			How you tried to set them free
			They would not listen, they did not know how
			Perhaps they'll listen now
			Starry, starry night
			Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
			Swirling clouds in violet haze
			Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china-blue
			Colors changing hue
			Morning fields of amber grain
			Weathered faces lined in pain
			Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
			Now I understand
			What you tried to say to me
			How you suffered for your sanity
			And how you tried to set them free
			They would not listen, they did not know how

			But I could've told you, Vincent
			This world was never meant for
			One as beautiful as you
			Starry, starry night
			Portraits hung in empty halls
			Frameless heads on nameless walls
			With eyes that watch this world and can't forget
			Like the strangers that you've met
			The ragged men in ragged clothes
			A silver thorn of bloody rose
			Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
			Now I think I know

			You're gonna do that for me?

			There was a boy
			Very strange, enchanted boy
			They say he wandered very far
			Very far over land and sea
			A little shy and sad of eye
			But very wise was he
			And then one day
			A magic day he passed my way
			Though we talked of many thing, fools and kings
			This he said to me
			"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
			Is just to love and be loved in return"
			Starry, starry night
			Paint your palette blue and gray
			Look out on a summer's day
			With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
			Shadows on the hills
			Sketch the trees and the daffodils
			Catch the breeze and the winter chills
			In colors on the snowy linen land
