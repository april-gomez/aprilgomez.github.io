					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> Give Your Cat Space </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p>
					<p class = "info"> In a small apartment, it can be pretty hard for a cat to have privacy. However, even 
						the most social cat requires some time alone now and then, which is very relatable. An 
						enclosed kitty bed offers a comfortable area for your cat to hang out while still providing 
						a little shelter from humans, too.</p>
					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> Find a Perfect Place for you Cat's Litter Box </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p> 
					<p class = "info"> When it comes to feline litter, there are a lot of considerations. However, your main concerns might be smell 
						and mess in your apartment, but this greatly depends on where you put the litter box. The ideal places tend to be 
						the balcony or bathroom. </p>
					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> Provide Your Feline with Scratching Objects </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p> 
					<p class = "info"> Scratching is very healthy for your cat. Besides keeping the cat’s nails sharp and healthy, scratching helps 
						cats mark their territory. Their nail curves help them leave a chemical scent wherever they scratch, which is 
						why most cats will scratch on furniture even when they have a scratching post. </p>
					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> Clean the Litter Box Daily </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p> 
					<p class = "info"> Most pet owners, particularly those living in apartments, may get a bit lax with their home maintenance, 
						especially when it comes to litter boxes. However, if you are a cat owner living in a small apartment, you need 
						to be passionately cleaning your litter box at least once per day. That is hygienic and will also keep the odor 
						from spreading through your already limited space.</p>
					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> Sweep and Vacuum Often </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p> 
					<p class = "info"> Cats shed regardless of their fur height. You might not see it as much since they groom themselves regularly, 
						but their fur will accumulate on about everything. However, their hair becomes much more visible in small spaces 
						like apartments. </p>

					<p class = "info" style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center"> What cats do eat </p> <br> <br>
					<p class = "info" style ="text-align:center"> Most of your kitty's diet should be a nutritionally complete cat food, 
						but you can give them a treat from your play every once in a while. You just need to 
						know how to choose feline-friendly snacks with nutrients they need. And if you do give
						them fish, be sure it isn't raw. <br> <br>
					<p class = "info"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> Cats are <b> meat </b> eaters, plain and simple. </p>
					<p class = "info"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b> Whole Grains </b> are allowed fro cats, oats have a lot of protein per caloria, and they're easy to make. </p>

					<p class = "info"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b> Milk, Cheese and other dairy products </b> are not allowed for cats

					<p class = "maininfo" style = "border: 0" > What to expect when living with cats</p>
					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> Care and Attention your cat need </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p>
					<p class = "info"> As pets go, cats are relatively low maintenance compared to dogs which need companionship, walking, training etc. 
						However, like any pet, they do need care, and some cats need more care than others. Do you want to spend a lot of time 
						with your cat, do you want it to be demanding, or do you have limited time? Cats can fit into busy, modern lifestyles 
						more easily than dogs, as they are pretty independent, can be left alone much more easily and are more suitable for 
						smaller flats or houses. Cats are often chosen by people who have busy and stressful lifestyles and who want some 
						companionship when they go home to relax. </p>
					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> I'm Allergic to cats! </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p>
					<p class = "info"> Many people think it’s a cat’s hair that causes us to react to them by sneezing, wheezing or itching. In fact it’s a protein or allergen 
						called Fd1, present in feline saliva, which causes the allergy. Because cats groom themselves regularly they have saliva all over their 
						coat.  This dries on the coat and when the cat scratches, moves or brushes past objects the dust or dander and the hairs which contain the 
						allergen are spread about. Cat-lovers who really want to have a cat but are allergic sometimes think that by choosing a breed with less, 
						little or no coat they can avoid the problem. However, as it is saliva that causes the problem, this is unlikely to help, and although 
						longhaired cats do seem to cause more allergic reactions that’s probably only because, having more hair, they’re also covered with more 
						allergen.</p>
					<p class = "titles"> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> <b><i> Yes! They get sick too! </i></b> <img src = "image/paws.png"> </img> </p>
					<p class = "info"> Keep an eye out for any coughing, sneezing, lethargy, or stomach upset in your new kitten. Young kittens are more 
						susceptible to getting sick since their immune system is still developing and their smaller size makes them more 
						susceptible to low blood sugar, dehydration, and other problems with missed meals and episodes of vomiting and/or 
						diarrhea. Make sure they are dewormed to protect them from intestinal parasites, and that they receive recommended 
						vaccines on time. Inform your veterinarian if you notice any symptoms. </p>
