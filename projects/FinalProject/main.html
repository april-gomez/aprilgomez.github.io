					<p class = "info"> Cat is a domestic species of small carnivours mammal. It is the only domesticated
						species in the family Felidae and is commonly reffered to as the domestic cat or house cat
						to distinguish it from the wile members of the family. </p>
					<p class = "info"> The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body,
						quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night
						vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalization like
						meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specified body language. </p>
					<p class = "info"> Cats are among the most highly specialized of the flesh-eating mammals. Their brains
						are large and well developed. Cats are digitigrade; that is, they walk on their toes. Unlike the dog
						and horse, the cat walks or runs by moving first the front and back legs on one side, then the front
						and back legs on the other side; only the camel and the giraffe moves in a similar way. <p>
